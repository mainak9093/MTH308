## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- MATLAB (for .m files)
- Basic understanding of numerical methods

### Compilation and Execution

For C++ implementations:
```bash
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
./program_name
```

For MATLAB implementations:
```matlab
% Run the .m file directly in MATLAB

The Newton-Raphson implementation solves equations of the form f(x) = x² - 4sin(x) = 0[2]:

```cpp
// Input: initial guess and error tolerance
// Output: root approximation with iteration details
```

### Jacobi Method
Solves linear systems Ax = b iteratively[4]:

```cpp
// Example system: Ax = b where A is coefficient matrix
// Converges to solution within specified tolerance
```

### LU Decomposition
Decomposes matrix A into lower (L) and upper (U) triangular matrices[3]:

```cpp
// Input: n×n matrix A
// Output: L and U matrices such that A = LU
```
